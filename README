* Tests
 Some of the socket tests require an echo server runing locally.
You can either compile and run the provided tests/echo-server.c
or enabled the echo services in (x)inetd.
Note: on Darwin, this can be achieved by uncommenting the echo
 service in /etc/inetd.conf and running:
   sudo xinetd -dontfork -inetd_compat)
Otherwise, set iolib-tests:*echo-address* and iolib-test:*echo-port*
appropriately if you want to point the echo tests somewhere else.

* Generating documentation
 To generate the documentation, use this patched version of
texinfo-docstrings: http://gitorious.org/iolib/texinfo-docstrings
Then make sure that IOLib's .asd files and texinfo-docstrings.asd can
be loaded and run GNU make inside doc/ ; you'll then find the
generated docs under manual/. This procedure has only been tested
with SBCL.
